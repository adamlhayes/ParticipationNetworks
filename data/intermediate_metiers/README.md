## Intermediate data from metier analysis

1. Reference year fish tickets with metiers identified with `infomap`, by port group

2. Non-reference year fish tickets with metiers assigned using KNN / identified with `infomap`, by port group

When identifying metiers with `infomap`, barplots are generated showing the species group and gear group distributions of each new metier. This will be saved into the `plot` folder.
